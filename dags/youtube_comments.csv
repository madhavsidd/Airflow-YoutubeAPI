@twickAttack,"Hey Jay, thank you for the video. I'd be happy to see you doing more ELT pipelines and focus on your thought's process ( I can watch longer format 1-2 hours) -  why you do things in that way, why is it important and whatnot; and you can throw some explainers to anything else you do and the reason behind it. I think senior DE and others with experience do things bit automatically and it takes time for the newbies to pick up on those skills. So, your thought process for doing things instead of just doing the things is priceless for anyone watching, including me. Appreciate your video, dude :)",2024-02-26T17:25:03Z
